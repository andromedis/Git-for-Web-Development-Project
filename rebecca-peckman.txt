    1. What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML is HTML that both formats content within tags and whose tag names have meanings that describe the underlying structure of the content.
 
    2. What is HTML used for?

HTML is used to add formatting and structure to a webpage so that it will be displayed a certain and consistent way within any particular web browser.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 

An attribute is a modifier to a particular HTML tag that gives that tag more information. It is placed within the <> brackets, after the tag name and a space, or after a previous attribute's name and a space.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes

Two tags that have required attributes are the <a> anchor tag, and the <img> image tag. The <a> tag requires the href attribute used to create a link. The <img> tag requires the src and alt attributes, describing the path to the image intended for display, and text that will be displayed if the image cannot be.

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 

The <head> element of an HTML document is used to add metadata that is not displayed on the page, such as the title of the page for SEO and display within the web browser, CSS <style> tags, or more commonly <link> tags that attach an external CSS stylesheet.

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div

A section is a particular section of a webpage's content that is generally not part of the header or footer of the page. It is a semantic tag. A div is a container for any subsection of a page, and can even encompass the entire page's content. It is not a semantic tag.

A class can be used for any number of elements in a page, while an id can only be used for one. A class might be added to elements that are all images that should be displayed the same way. An id should be added to a single element that needs to be specifically referenced, such as a location name that will be used in Javascript code on the page.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?

.sidebar a {

}

Use the rm [filename] command. You need to be careful doing this because it does not ask for confirmation that you actually want to delete the file, and you could lose important work or data.

    34. Why should I use version control? 

Version control is useful because it helps you keep track of different versions of code as you make changes. That lets multiple people work on the same code at once and then merge their work together, and lets you roll back to a previous version if there are issues with new changes.

    35. How often should I commit to github?

You should commit locally any time you make a significant change to your project. You should push to github any time you want to publish your current version to the internet.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 

Fork the repository on Github.
Clone your fork to your computer with the command:
git clone [repository-link]
Enter the local repo with the command:
cd [repository-link]
Create your own branch with the command:
git checkout -b [firstname]-[lastname]
Add or change files in the repo to work on your project.
Locally commit changes with the commands:
git add .; git commit -m "message"
Push committed changes to the Github repo with the command:
git push -u origin [branch-name]
Go to the forked repo on Github, click master/main and then [firstname]-[lastname] from the dropown, then click "new pull request".
Change the "base repository" dropdown to have your forked version, then click "create pull request".
